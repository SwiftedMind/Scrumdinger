# Scrumdinger
This project is a re-implementation of Apple's [Scrumdinger](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-scrumdinger) tutorial app in the [Puddles architecture](https://github.com/SwiftedMind/Puddles) that I'm working on. It is my attempt at creating a modular and scalable app structure.

The idea of using this example app to test out different ideas and architectures is an idea by [Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co/). They built a version of the app based on their [Modern SwiftUI](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/swiftui/modern-swiftui) series. You can find it here: [Standups](https://github.com/pointfreeco/standups).
